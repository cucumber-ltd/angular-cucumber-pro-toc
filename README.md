# TOC

A small angular directive to render the table of contents for a project in [Cucumber Pro](https://app.cucumber.pro)

## Contributing

Install dependencies:

`npm install && bower install`

Run the tests

`karma start`

Edit `src/toc.js`

## Manual testing

The directive is test-driven, but it can still be useful to run it standalone for a manual test to visualse how it works.

Just open the file `manual-test.html` in the root of this project.
