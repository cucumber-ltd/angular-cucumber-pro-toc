*What is this?*

This is a simple angular module that contains the behaviour to render a list of documents as a table of contents.

*Is it done yet?*

Nope

*Why in a separate repo?*

It's an experiement in how we can avoid having a bloated angular app. I think that if we build it out of little self-contained components like this, we'll have a faster test suite and more fun!
